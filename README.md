# hello-again
I'm reviewing my github knowledge. This time I will pay great attention to details.
Now I'm in the branch creation and commit section. Before I commit my changes, I need to write why I made the particular change sothat others can understand what I've done and why. My commit messages has to capture a clear history of my changes.
